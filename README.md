# MY FINAL PROJECT (Web App Track)
## Title: Tahfeezio Quran Memorisation Buddy

### Problem Statement
As part of his religious studies, my son needs to memorise lots of verses within a short period of time and it can be a feat sometimes.
We have a 'system' of learning that has been working for us (through trial and error) but it's really manual and hard to keep track of progress.
What I want to be able to do is create a web app for it to help him track his memorisation and to gamify the process so it makes it more enjoyable and 'sticky'.
